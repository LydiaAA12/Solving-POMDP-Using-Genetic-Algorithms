Introduction

With the emergence of autonomous technology, trust
in the systems has become crucial for users to be able to use
them effectively. One of the methods devised to affect trust of
users in autonomous agents is algorithmic assurances. These are
components built into intelligent agents to calibrate users’ trust.
We look closely into self-confidence metrics and how to improve
human-trust relationship by improving the factors that affect this
measurement. Specifically ,we apply an optimization to improve
the solver quality (which is one of the components in computing
self-confidence) of an autonomous system’s decision making. An
attempt has been made in this paper to analyze the efficiency
of Genetic Algorithms on solving a POMDP problem embedded
in a pursuit-evasion scenario. Simulation of the optimal policy
generated by our algorithm show that the proposed theory of
optimization indeed performs as expected. Thus our assumption
that genetic algorithms can be used a quality solver for POMDP
problems proven by our work can be the basis for a more
accurate calculation of self-confidence metrics.
